# Coursera [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) - Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew NG et al.

Notes by [*Ricardo Santos*](linkedin.com/in/ricardo-santos-3440bb29)

This repository is a placeholder for my notes on Andrew NG's (et al.) Coursera [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) deep learning specialization including all 5 courses:

  * Neural Networks and Deep Learning
  * Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization 
  * Structuring Machine Learning Projects
  * Convolutional Neural Networks 
  * Sequence Models  

These were not thoroughly reviewed (comments/feedback are welcome), and are meant to be used as a quick reference for the topics covered in the courses, not as a replacement for that content. 

A [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) rendered `.pdf` file is provided, as well as a `.md`  source file, that is better viewed with this fork of [instant-markdown-d](https://github.com/twidxuga/instant-markdown-d) given that it contains latex formulas and a TOC, in combination with this fork of [instant-markdown-preview](https://github.com/twidxuga/vim-instant-markdown) plugin for [Neovim](https://neovim.io/).
